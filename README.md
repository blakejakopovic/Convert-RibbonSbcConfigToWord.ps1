The name’s a bit of a mouthful, but “Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1” takes the backup file from your Sonus/Ribbon SBC 1000/2000/SWe Lite gateway and creates a new Word document, with all of the important(?) configuration information captured in tables.

<p>The name&rsquo;s a bit of a mouthful, but &ldquo;Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1&rdquo; takes the backup file from your Sonus/Ribbon SBC 1000/2000/SWeLite gateway and creates a new Word document, with all of the important(?) configuration information captured  in tables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It started life as a way to save the tedium of screen-scraping lots of fixed frames for my as-built documents, but it quickly became apparent that it would also make a useful tool for the offline review of a gateway&rsquo;s config (although it ain&rsquo;t  no &ldquo;UxBuilder&rdquo;).</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decodes gateway versions up to 8.1.0 &amp; SWe Lite. </li>
<li>Converts and saves the config to a new Word document, and optionally makes a PDF of it too. </li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t need any Lync PowerShell modules &ndash; it&rsquo;s fine on your Win7-Win10 machine (which needs to have Word installed). </li>
<li>Tested on Word 2010, 2013 &amp; 2016. </li>
<li>Reasonably well debugged throughout (although time will tell of course!). </li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy enough to turn off an unwanted section if you&rsquo;re only interested in a specific subset of the functionality, or are adapting to suit your environment. </li>
<li>Use the "RedactIP" switch to strip all IP addresses from the resulting file. </li>
<li>A &ldquo;-SkipWrite&rdquo; switch skips the relatively slow process of writing to Word. I added this for debugging and have left it in the released version to help anyone refining or enhancing the script. </li>
<li>From v2 the script has been signed, so no longer requires you to drop your ExecutionPolicy to &ldquo;Unrestricted&rdquo;. This also means you can be confident the code&rsquo;s not changed since it left here. </li>
<li>Uses your existing Word document template for the formatting of the table headings and table of contents. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not the fastest to run! Stuffing values into Word is a relatively slow process. With all options enabled allow up to 10 minutes for your average gateway. I&rsquo;ve stolen Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s "<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgressBarsInPowerShell.aspx" target="_blank">Progress  Bars in PowerShell</a>&rdquo; to help the watched pot boil. </li>
<li>v8.0 captures even more of the gateway&rsquo;s config than before, however it still doesn&rsquo;t capture EVERYTHING. There&rsquo;s an enormous amount in there, and it&rsquo;s growing with each release! If you find I&rsquo;ve not captured a particularly  valuable element of the config, feel free to revise it to suit your needs &ndash; and send me the new bits to incorporate, please. If you&rsquo;re not feeling up to it, send me a sample config file and some screen-grabs of the bit you&rsquo;d like to see added. </li>
<li>There are MANY hash tables throughout. (This is where an integer is stored in the config file, but it&rsquo;s decoded to text on-screen). I&rsquo;ve put a lot of effort into capturing these, but there are going to be examples where I&rsquo;ve missed one.  Please send me screen-grabs and sample config files and I&rsquo;ll update the script. </li>
<li>I&rsquo;m largely letting Word control the width of the table columns, and you&rsquo;ll find many instances where it&rsquo;s done a poor job. You may need to edit every document the script produces to resolve this. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Backup your gateway, saving the config file somewhere accessible. Older gateway versions (pre 2.2.1) will save to an archive called &ldquo;backup.tar.gz&rdquo;, while newer versions save as &ldquo;SBC_Config_&lt;hostname&gt;_&lt;version&gt;_&lt;date&gt;.tar&rdquo; </li>
<li>Older backups you&rsquo;ll need to unzip <em>twice</em> to recover the &ldquo;symphonyconfig.xml&rdquo; document we need, whilst newer ones only need one unzip to reveal their goodness <br /> &gt;&gt; If you have <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-zip</a> installed you no longer need to unzip &ldquo;SBC_Config_&lt;hostname&gt;_&lt;version&gt;_&lt;date&gt;.tar&rdquo; - just feed the .tar file as the "-inputfile" </li>
<li>Open a PowerShell window </li>
<li>Now feed the backup into the script! Either place the config file in the same path as the script, give the full path in the command line, or a relative path:
<pre>PS H:\&gt; Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1 -InputFile "symphonyconfig.xml" -OutputFile "CustomerSBC-config.docx"</pre>
If you don&rsquo;t specify an InputFile, the script goes looking for "symphonyconfig.xml" in its directory. If you don&rsquo;t specify an OutputFile, it will re-use the name of the InputFile and save as &ldquo;.docx&rdquo;, overwriting any existing file of  the same name in that directory. If you add the &ldquo;-MakePdf&rdquo; switch, it will save the same output filename as a .pdf as well </li>
</ol>
<p>You can easily batch it:</p>
<pre>PS H:\&gt; Get-ChildItem "d:\path\*.xml" -recurse | .\Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1 -IncludeNodeInfo -MakePdf -SkipUpdateCheck</pre>
<pre>PS H:\&gt; Get-ChildItem "d:\path\*.tar" -recurse | .\Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1 -MakePdf -SkipUpdateCheck</pre>

<h3>Help me improve the script</h3>
<p>PLEASE let me know if you encounter any problems. All I ask is a copy of the .tar or symphonyconfig.xml file (de-identified as you wish), and a screen-grab from the browser to show me what it's <em>meant</em> to look like on-screen.</p>
